    title: "How is NOZE different from other air quality monitors?",
    des: "The technology behind NOZE is based on a digital nose sensor (also known as an e-nose). With this sensor, NOZE can precisely detect a wide range of pollutants and chemicals. In contrast, almost all other air quality monitors on the market today use a bundle of off-the-shelf sensors that are limited in what they can detect and can vary widely in quality, accuracy and reliability.",

    title: "What is a digital nose?",
    des: "A digital nose is a breakthrough technology that digitizes the sense of smell. Itâ€™s similar to how the camera digitized the sense of sight and the microphone digitized the sense of hearing.",

    title: "What is the Virus Risk Index?",
    des: "The Virus Risk Index is an AI-powered tool built into NOZE to help make indoor spaces safer places to live, work, and visit by monitoring the risk of virus transmission (tracking how conducive the air is to spreading the virus) and the risk of virus presence (tracking the likelihood that the virus is in the air).",

    title: "What space can it cover?",
    des: "The molecules in every gas and odour have different properties which impact how far they can travel and how fast they can be detected. A good rule of thumb for a typical indoor space is that NOZE can cover an area of up to 800 square feet (80 square meters) without barriers like walls or doors.",

    title: "How many NOZE devices do I need?",
    des: "If you want to monitor different rooms at the same time, we suggest that you place one NOZE in each room, depending on the layout. If you only have one NOZE then you should monitor the room where you spend most of your time or are the most concerned about.",
